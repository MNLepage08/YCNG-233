## Time Series Analysis Fundamentals

#### 1. Introduction to Time Series problems
  - Time series: a suite of data point ordered over time. The minimal information in a time series is the datetime (or the timestamp) of the datapoint and the value itself. The value can be discrete or continuous.
  - UTC is a continuous value, but it might be hard to extract information such as the season, the night/day... For data science purpose, the preferred representation is a datetime + explicit time zone. [Datetime Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) & [Pytz Library](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

  - [Resample:](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html) You cannot assume data are equally distributer overtime. You must check it. Resampling will help to Handle duplicates and Highlight missing data.
  - Filling missing data: Many ways. The 2 mostly used are [Interpolation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html) and [Forward Fill](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html)
  - Just as correlation measures the extent of a linear relationship between two variables, autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between lagged values of a time series. The [autocorrelation function](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.stattools.acf.html) describes the relationship between a time series and its lagged counterpart. The [partial autocorrelation](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/generated/statsmodels.tsa.stattools.pacf.html) describes a direct relationship, that is, it removes the effects of the intermediate lagged values.
  - [Time Series Decomposition: ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/) Involves thinking of a series as a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components.
  - [Stationary vs. Non-Stationary: ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-data-stationary-python/) A stationary series is one where the values of the series is not a function of time. Mean(ts) = Mean(slide), Variance(ts) = Variance(slide), Autocorrelation(ts) = Autocorrelation(slice). Test: Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test
